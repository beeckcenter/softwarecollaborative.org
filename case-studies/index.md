# Case Studies

## Introduction

As part of our work to understand and support collaboratives, our team conducts research at varying levels to produce case studies of collaborative organizations and products. Our hope that that case studies will provide thorough, real-life examples for practitioners to learn from and material to inform fellow researchers interested in this field.

We currently publish two types of case study: in-depth case studies that involve interviews, observation sessions, and weeks of research, and our Anatomy of a Collaborative series, which consists of lighter weight case studies created primarily from desk research and perhaps one or two conversations with the featured organization.
