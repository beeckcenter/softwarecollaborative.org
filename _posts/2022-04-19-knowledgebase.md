Title: Introducing the ISC Knowledge Base 

We regularly hear members of our [software collaborative network](https://groups.google.com/u/0/a/georgetown.edu/g/software-coops?pli=1) express a desire for a shared knowledge base of articles, best practices, playbooks, websites, etc. around software collaboration, especially with an intergovernmental lens. We’re excited to introduce the first version of this [collaborative knowledge base](https://airtable.com/shr3BE3zCqCdyeGSL/tblGKJHxQVrhx49CS)! 

For now, this is a simple Airtable containing some resources we've compiled. Each card has information such as the link, tags identifying relevant topics, format (e.g. book or report), and why we think the resource is useful. Anyone can submit to the knowledge base using the form linked in the first card titled "* Submit resource here!"

Please contribute any resources that you've found helpful in your work developing, funding, or governing shared software or services or open source projects. 

Not sure if something is a good fit for the knowledge base? Send an email to the google group to ask the community!

We would also love any feedback on the format and content of this knowledge base so that we can continue to iterate and expand it.
