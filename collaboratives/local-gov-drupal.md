## Description

LocalGov Drupal is a collection of modifications to Drupal 8 to address needs that are common to council websites in the United Kingdom.

In October of 2019, [the UK’s Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/31/weve-funded-more-collaborative-projects-through-the-local-digital-fund/):

> London Borough of Croydon has been awarded £75,000 for a discovery on improving code-sharing between councils, removing blockers to sharing code and helping projects to collaborate. They will partner with Bracknell Forest Council, Brighton & Hove City Council and Oxford City Council.

[Croyden announced the start of the work](https://croydon.digital/2019/12/20/overcoming-the-barriers-to-code-sharing-between-councils/) in December of 2019 and, after six weeks of work, they [reported back on their findings](https://croydon.digital/2020/04/01/what-4-councils-learned-about-sharing-drupal-code/), finding "an enormous appetite for sharing" and concluding that they needed to take "a 'coding club' route rather than exploring selling the platform as a service." They published [their governance process](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sRUf8_bBc4WSUnMzfv23U_60h90B6jOd/view) before embarking on six sprints over the following three months.

The work was performed by council employees, rather than by a vendor. They worked in public, prodicing notes on the results of each sprint (e.g., [sprint 3](https://agile.coop/blog/local-gov-drupal-sprint-3-notes/)).

In December 2020, [Croyden announced they had switched over to running LocalGov Drupal on the council’s new website](https://croydon.digital/2020/12/17/croydon-goes-live-with-localgov-drupal/), and that work was actively being done on the code base by Croydon, Bracknell Forest, Brighton, Lambeth, Waltham Forest, and Westminster.
