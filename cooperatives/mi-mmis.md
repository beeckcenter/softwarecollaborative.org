## Description
Michigan’s MMIS is said to be in use in Illinois as well, but there is lots of coverage of initial efforts in 2013–15, but little coverage of how that turned out. The website for Illinois’ MMIS, which appears to be up-to-date,” says that “rather than developing a new system, Illinois is obtaining a fully-operational, federally-certified MMIS partnership,” implying that they have abandoned their Michigan collaboration, but are seeking to begin a new collaboration.

The federal government is offering to fund 90 percent of MMIS upgrades and, according to a survey by the National Association of State CIOs, 78 percent of state CIOs said they expect to modernize their MMIS by 2014.

The Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services and Michigan Department of Community Health executed a preliminary intergovernmental agreement (IGA) in December 2012 to determine whether MMIS-as-a-service model would work. Further amendments to that initial agreement have been made to continue the process. Another IGA is under discussion to cover the next phases of the project.
