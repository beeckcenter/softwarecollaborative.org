## Description

They say:

>The mission of the ActivitySim project is to create and maintain advanced, open-source, activity-based travel behavior modeling software based on best software development practices for distribution at no charge to the public.
>
>The ActivitySim project is led by a consortium of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and other transportation planning agencies, which provides technical direction and resources to support project development. New member agencies are welcome to join the consortium. All member agencies help make decisions about development priorities and benefit from contributions of other agency partners.
>
>ActivitySim is administered by the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations Research Foundation, a Federal 501(c)(3) organization.

Seven years ago, the consortium was started by 3 public agencies: San Diego Association of Governments, Puget Sound Regional Council (Seattle), and Atlanta Regional Commission through pooled funding from their Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs).

AMPO has the established contracts with the procurement process. Anybody can contribute, you don't need to be an AMPO member. Effectively anybody can join, it's not codified in their rules.

They have two software projects: [ActivitySim](https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim) and [PopulationSim](https://github.com/ActivitySim/populationsim).
