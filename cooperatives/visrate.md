## Description

> VisRate is a program for collecting visual pavement distress data. Users download Mobility data into VisRate from within VisRate 4.1 and use the data for conducting pavement ratings. Users can connect a laptop computer with a vehicle's Digital Measurement Instrument (DMI). The laptop synchronizes with and operates a [Nite Star NS - 60 DMI](https://interwestsafety.com/products/ns60-nitestar-dmi) as the vehicle moves down the road. Users can upload pavement rating data into the Mobility database from VisRate using the Sync tool.

This Windows-based software dates to 1995, and is provided to counties by Washington’s County Road Administration Board.
