## Description
The planning for this Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, and North Dakota unemployment insurance software consortium started in 2009, [funded via a $62.2 million U.S. Department of Labor grant](https://www.greeleytribune.com/2021/01/10/colorado-unemployment-benefits-new-claims-system/). The states teamed up via a cooperative purchasing governance agreement (which appears to be a sort of an agreement unique to this project). They tried to build a monolithic system that would serve all of their needs, but it wasn't designed to manage the states’ different unemployment benefits processes. The states’ labor secretaries gave up after spending $15.4 million in federal funding, returning the unspending funding to the U.S. Department of Labor.
