## Description

“Code for Development provides access to applications, algorithms, spreadsheets, and other useful digital tools that address specific challenges. You can find software with different functions such as data analysis, content management, record management, image processing, and others. Our vision is that, when these tools are adapted and reused, they have the potential to promote economic and social development of Latin America and the Caribbean.”

Founded in 2017, Code for Development is produced by the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/overview), an organization focused on improving lives across Latin America and the Caribbean. Code for Development relies on [collaborators](https://code.iadb.org/en/contributors) to share their own software and tools, which it then evaluates for inclusion in its repository. The organization includes a [guide for documentation, licensing, and evaluating digital tools](https://el-bid.github.io/guia-de-publicacion/en/).
