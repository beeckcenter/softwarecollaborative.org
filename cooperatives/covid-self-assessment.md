## Description
Alberta Health Services created a COVID-19 self-assessment tool, which the Ontario Digital Service replicated, modified, and hosted their own copy of (and continued to iterate on). Alberta Health Services’ project Git commit history doesn’t show commits originating externally, so it is unclear if this is an instance of mere reuse or something more substantial.
