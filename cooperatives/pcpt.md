## Description
An open-source asset management platform developed by a private vendor for the Pennsylvania Bureau of Public Transportation. Thereâ€™s cause to believe that Pennsylvania is looking to share this with other states.

This software, the Pennsylvania Capital Planning Tool (CPT), was created under a collaborative agreement between PennDOT and the Virginia Division of Rail and Public Transit (DRPT) and was funded through an [FTA state-of-good-repair award] (https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grants/state-good-repair-grants-5337).
