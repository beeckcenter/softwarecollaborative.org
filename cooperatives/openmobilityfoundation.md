## Description
They say:

>The Open Mobility Foundation (OMF) is an open-source foundation that creates a governance structure around open-source mobility tools, beginning with a focus on the Mobility Data Specification (MDS). By creating an open source foundation, OMF is able to offer a safe, efficient environment for stakeholders including municipalities, companies, technical, privacy, and policy experts, and the public to shape urban mobility management tools that help public agencies accomplish their mobility policy goals.
>
>It is hosted by OASIS-Open, an established leader in open-source and software standards industry. OASIS is a nonprofit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society.
>
>The Open Mobility Foundation is governed by municipalities across the country that are united in finding solutions to shared transportation challenges. Joined by experts, advocates, and other stakeholders, the Foundation’s leaders work together — incorporating viewpoints and expertise from key groups and communities — to develop open source urban mobility tools. All OMF Members (including Public and Non-public members) may participate at the committee and project level.
