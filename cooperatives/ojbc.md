## Description
The Open Justice Broker Consortium is a non-profit membership organization of government agencies and jurisdictions, dedicated to improving justice information sharing through the reuse of low-cost, standards-based integration software. It includes a set of integrated justice information sharing components built on the Apache integration stack (Karaf, CXF, Camel). The software is used to integrate records from police, prisons, and courts, making it possible to query records across disparate law enforcement records management systems. Additionally, the Consortium has the goal of both reducing costs and increasing the speed of implementing an integrated justice system across the United States. 

It is a non-profit membership organization of government agencies and jurisdictions, dedicated to improving justice information sharing through the reuse of low-cost, standards-based integration software. The OJBC unlocks the power of open source software and cross-boundary collaboration to promote a more effective, efficient justice system. They have 4 people dedicated to software, 2 of which are full-time programmers, and one person who is a hybrid programmer and does standards.

OJBC was started System for the Electronic Analysis and Retrieval of Criminal Histories (SEARCH) as a project funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to shre criminal records from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. SEARCH has provided the Consortium with administrative support and staff services since 2012.

OJBC is governed by a Board of Directors. Full members of the Consortium can vote for and serve on the Board. OJBC members are also typically members of SEARCH. The Board has final decision-making authority on all matters of Consortium governance. OJBC meets regularly with members to determine product needs and direction.

OJBC publishes all software under an open source license, and charge only for membership. [Membership runs from $995/year up to $85,000/year](https://www.ojbc.org/membership/), with three tiers of membership that depend on eligibility, technical support requirements, and ability to serve on the Board.
