## Description

[APHL describes AIMS as](https://www.aphl.org/programs/informatics/Pages/aims_platform.aspx):

> AIMS is a secure, cloud based platform that accelerates the implementation of health messaging by providing shared services to aid in the visualization, interoperability, security and hosting of electronic data. [...] Our trading partners include federal agencies, the United States Uniformed Services, regional commercial laboratories and hospitals, State Health Information Exchanges and 50 state public health jurisdictions.

[Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) describes themselves](https://www.aphl.org/aboutAPHL/Pages/profile.aspx) as follows:

> The Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) works to strengthen laboratory systems serving the public’s health in the United States and globally.

APHL represents state and local governmental health laboratories in the United States. Its members, known as “public health laboratories,” monitor, detect and respond to health threats. While members may be public health labs, APHL software may connect to or serve public or private healthcare providers or labs. APHL controls software governance and pricing. APHL is funded by the CDC, and entities that conect to or use AIMS may also pay license or usage fees.
