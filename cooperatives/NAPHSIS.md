## Description
The National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) represents the state vital records and public health statistics offices in the United States. It formed in 1933 and consists of more than 250 public health professionals from each state in the U.S., as well as the five territories, New York City, and the District of Columbia.

Over the past two decades, vital records data has been increasingly useful in identity verification for the public and private sector. NAPHSIS uses its two systems, State and Territorial Exchange of Vital Events (STEVE) and Electronic Verification of Vital Events (EVVE), to confirm vital events that affect identity verification. 

STEVE is governed by NAPHSIS and its members. Participants of the system include federal stakeholders at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and state/local government agency users. 

EVVE is also owned by NAPHSIS, and it allows jurisdictions to maintain control over data access and retain full governance of their data. It is a query-based tool that allows jurisdictions to have control over who is allowed to query their data.

Members of NAPHSIS must be professionally engaged in vital record, public health statistics, or public health information systems and are limited to state, territory, and local health departments or other non-federal government agencies in the U.S.
