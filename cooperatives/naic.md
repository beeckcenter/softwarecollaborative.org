## Description

NAIC says about themselves:

>As part of our state-based system of insurance regulation in the United States, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides expertise, data and analysis for insurance commissioners to effectively regulate the industry and protect consumers. The U.S. standard-setting organization is governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 jurisdictions, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate regulatory oversight.

The NAIC is funded through a number of revenue sources. The states, by way of membership dues, contribute less than 3 percent of the revenue the NAIC devotes to funding member-directed initiatives, as well as many other services that help the states work together collaboratively and cooperatively. Other sources of revenue include database filing fees, product filing fees, producer-licensing fees and sales of NAIC publications and data. Without membership in the NAIC, the amount of state funding required in order to provide or access the similar type of services the NAIC provides – often at no extra charge – would far exceed what a state pays in membership dues to the NAIC.

They offer an impressive breadth of SaaS tools for the benefit of their members:

>The NAIC develops and maintains software tools to enable state insurance regulators throughout the country to increase productivity and streamline business processes. These tools help regulators to submit and retrieve data, formulate data for decision making, and access information needed to do their jobs. [...] NAIC technology is developed, enhanced and maintained as a service to state insurance departments.
