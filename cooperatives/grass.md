## Description
Although GRASS GIS is not a government-created or -maintained tool, this open source GIS tool is widely used within government agencies, especially at a state and municipal level, and governments and public universities have sponsored its development and maintenance.

GRASS GIS has been under continuous development since 1982, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) started exploring the use of GIS for environmental research, monitoring and management of military lands.
