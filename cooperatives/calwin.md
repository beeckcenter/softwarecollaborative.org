# Description

Eighteen counties in California jointly purchased benefits determination software from Deloitte and EDS, calling themselves the CalWIN Consortium. “The CalWIN System is managed by the Welfare Client Data Systems Subcommittee (WCDS) which is comprised of 18 California Counties. WCDS is governed by the CalSAWS Joint Powers Authority (JPA) Board of Directors.” It is a “client-based, on-line, real-time update, automated eligibility determination, benefit calculation, and management system.

It’s unclear whether this is a software cooperative, or simply a bunch of counties that have teamed up for a discount on commercial software.
