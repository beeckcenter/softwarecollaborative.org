## Description
This unemployment insurance software consortium originally included North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, but Georgia pulled out in 2019. Work began in 2013, with a $50 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. Software development was outsourced to Capgemini. The cloud-hosted service is now in use in both North and South Carolina.
