## Description
NASBA offers its CPE Audit Service platform to State Boards of Accountancy to use as an automated tool for conducting their audits of licensee compliance with the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) requirements. Eligible boards are participating in the Accountancy Licensee Database (ALD) with license data records that are properly linked across state lines. The platform is configured for CPAs to report CPE hours and documentation to the Boards electronically, and State Boards of Accountancy are provided administrative tools for evaluating submitted credits and documentation for compliance with State Board CPE rules and regulations during the audit process.
