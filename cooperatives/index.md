# Intergovernmental Software Cooperatives

## Introduction

There are many dozens — probably hundreds — of intergovernmental software cooperatives around the world. These organizations take many forms, but what they all have in common is that they bring multiple governments together to collectively contribute to and benefit from custom software. Sometimes they span nations, sometimes states, tribes or territories, sometimes municipalities, and sometimes municipalities in the same larger jurisdiction. Some cooperatives have all 50 U.S. states as members, some are shared by just two governments. Some of these are going strong after 30 years, others failed after two years.

This inventory is largely U.S.-centric, and limited to those with information available about them in English. The inventory is inconsistent about listing cooperatives by the name of the cooperative versus the name of the software that is shared — many entries required a judgment call as to which to lead with.
