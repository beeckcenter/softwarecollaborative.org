## Description
D4AD initiatives aimed to expand access to education and career data to provide students, workers, and jobseekers with better data-driven information leading to more informed career decisions in a changing economy.

The National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) was the implementation partner for this initiative. NCHEMS is a private nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve strategic decision making in postsecondary education for states, systems, institutions, and workforce development organizations in the United States and abroad.

It is funded by Schmidt Futures, Lumina Foundation, Walmart, and the Walton Family Foundation.
