# Publications

## Introduction

As part of our work to understand and support collaboratives, our team conducts research at varying levels studying collaborative organizations and products. Our hope that that these publications will provide thorough, real-life examples and analysis for practitioners to learn from and material to inform fellow researchers interested in this field.

We currently publish three types of publications: in-depth case studies that involve interviews, observation sessions, and weeks of research; our Anatomy of a Collaborative series, which consists of lighter weight case studies created primarily from desk research and perhaps one or two conversations with the featured organization; and reports that offer looks at trends and insights across the ecosystem.
