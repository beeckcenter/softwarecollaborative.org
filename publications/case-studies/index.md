# Case Studies

Long-form analyses of an intergovernmental software collaborative to gain a deep, multi-faceted understanding of how these groups operate in real-life context. Case studies offer original findings gathered through methods like stakeholder interviews, observations, and document analysis to surface nuanced learnings and trends regarding a collaborativeâ€™s formation, growth edges, and successes. This form of study also contributes to emergent theory about intergovernmental software collaboratives, which may be of interest to other researchers and, as well as practitioners.
